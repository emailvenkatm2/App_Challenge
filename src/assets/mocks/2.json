        "longDescription": "<div class=\"content_style\">\r\n<p><b>Lightning and Surge Protection</b><br />\r\nSurgeArrest components such as MOVs and Thermal fuse ensure instantaneous reaction to lightning strikes and wiring faults. If the surge components are damaged due to power spike or over voltage, excess power cannot reach your equipment. Unlike the APC SurgeArrest products, most surge suppressors continue to let power through even after circuits have been damaged, leaving your equipment exposed to other damaging surges. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>IEEE Let-Through Rating and UL 1449 Compliance</b><br />\r\nThe 'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) Let-Through Voltage rating is based on a test that subjects a Surge Protector to a 6,000 volt spike. The rating equates to the amount of excess voltage that reaches connected equipment. The lower the number, the better the performance of the Surge Protector is. Underwriter's Laboratory's UL1449 surge protection safety standard uses these ratings to help users gauge performance. UL's best Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) Let-Through Voltage rating is \"300V\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Data-line Protection</b><br />\r\nProtection of data lines (Ethernet, Coaxial and Phone lines) ensures complete protection of your equipment from surges. It is very important to protect your equipment from \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdback door\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd surges traveling through data lines, as they can be as damaging to your equipment as surges traveling over power lines. Noise Filtering Surge Protector attenuates EMI/RFI line noise that can cause data errors and keyboard lockups, ensuring better performance of protected\r\nequipment.</p></div>",
